# LUNA16_NoduleClassification

This project is an implementation of the paper "Pulmonary Nodule Classification Using Feature and Ensemble Learning-Based Fusion Techniques". The goal of the paper is to classify lung cancer nodules extracted from the CT scans available in LUNA16 dataset using deep features. In particular the features are extracted from pretrained deep neural network like AlexNet and VGG.
